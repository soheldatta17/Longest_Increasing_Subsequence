# Longest_Increasing_Subsequence

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest (strictly) increasing subsequence from the given array.

Input:

N = 16
A = {0,8,4,12,2,10,6,14,1,9,5,13,3,11,7,15}

Output: 

6

Explanation:

There are more than one LIS in this array. One such Longest increasing subsequence is {0,2,6,9,13,15}.
